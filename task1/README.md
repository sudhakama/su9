# README #

Welcome to your [`REFCODES.ORG`](http://www.refcodes.org) `archetype` based ` artifact`. This archetype has been generated by invoking the following command:

```
mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=org.refcodes \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=refcodes-console-ext-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion=2.0.5 \
  -DgroupId=task1 \
  -DartifactId=task1 \
  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

> Feel free to replace this `REDAME.md` file with some file of your own after having considered the below paragraphs.

### Getting started ###

To get up and running, you use this archetype together with [`Maven`](https://maven.apache.org). Just change into the newly created folder and invoke `mvn` to build your new application:

```
cd task1
mvn clean install
```

This will package your application into a [`fatjar`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19150811/what-is-a-fat-jar) which can be executed:

```
java -jar ./target/task1-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --help
```

When running a shell such as [`bash`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) then first (and once only) make sure the shell scripts are executable by changing the according file attributes and then invoke the `build.sh` script, so finally you can launch your application from inside the `target` folder:

```
chmod ug+x *.sh
```

> The `build.sh` script will finish off by printing out the actual path and the name of the created executable binary shell script.

```
./build.sh
./target/task1.sh --help
```

> In case your Artifact-ID `task1` contains a slash ("-"), then just the portion after the slash is used for your executable binary shell script's name.
